# dotfiles
This is a collection of rc files, systemd user services, and scripts that help
configure them for use. It is intended for my own personal use, but I am making
it publically available for reference. Seeing that the motivation is for my own
personal use not many configuration options will be present. Use at your own
risk.

Essentially the files in overlay are meant to be copied into the user's home
directory. There is a run-scripts.sh in the bin directory. This does a bunch of
stuff you probably don't want. It will prompt you once if you attempt to run
it. Don't run it unless you really know what you are doing.

If you have questions feel free to attempt to contact me.
